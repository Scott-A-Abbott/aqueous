## To Do
- Aqueous
  - Improve error handling
  - Add small scale feature examples
  - Projection needs a catchall
  - Handler and projection structs backed with a HashMap
    - The handler struct would need to contain the message type name
      - Catchall needs a hard coded string like "All"
    - The `add_*` functions should be renamed to `insert_*` and return a result
      - Errors when attempting to insert a function that works on a message type already handled
- Add a funds transfer component
- Logging in all the places
